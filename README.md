# Techlabs-quizz
### This is a simple quizz app I set up for the **"Project Phase Info + Track Cross Contamination"** event for Techlabs Berlin.


## Instructions:
### This app uses `localStorage`. It might not work properly on your machine. To prevent troubleshooting, use Google Chrome when running the app.

### If you have a problem with running the app in your Google Chrome after cloning it, run `google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files` in your terminal, then re-run the app. Also, check your browser's local storage (under **Application/Storage/Local Storage** in Chrome) and clear it if necessary.
